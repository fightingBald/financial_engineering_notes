    "## **3. What is Government Data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Government data is all the information that is collected by government entities. This data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Economic Data (GDP, inflation, employment rates, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demographic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Environmental Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Health Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Legal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agriculture Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Energy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Education Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real Estate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "and many more categories of data that a specific government may or may not choose to keep track of. The data above is **essential** for every decision-making mechanism incorporated by the government. For example, it is well established how economic data is important for monetary and fiscal policy or how health data helped the respective agencies in coordinating the healthcare system's response during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this data serve as evidence-based governance and their holistic view enables governments to make decisions for the future of a country within a complex reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Aspects of Government Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, we have seen the scope of government data, but there are other characteristics as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Volume: the volume of government data tends to be very large\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variety: many categories of structured and unstructured data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authoritative: it is official (the same data is used for policymaking)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timeliness: one can find real-time and historical data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality: there may be incomplete or inaccurate datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Format: data is saved in databases, files (CSV, JSON, etc.), reports, and other formats\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitivity/Accessibility: it may include personal information in which case it will be restricted\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metadata: the descriptions of the dataset serves as inventory for navigating the large volume of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, regarding the above characteristics, there has been a significant effort on behalf of several governments to implement transparency and openness in their data. These efforts gave rise to Open Government Data, which took the form of a movement that pushed many countries to provide public access to their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Open Government Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1966, the U.S. was the first to implement a policy for open data by establishing a legal framework called the \"Freedom of Information Act\" (FOIA). According to FOIA, any citizen can ask for public access to records from any federal agency. But this was \"reactive\" transparency since data was not open by default. The latter was only corrected in 2009 by the Open Government Directive, which mandated federal agencies to publish government information online and embrace open government policy. This was the decisive step from a \"reactive\" transparency to a \"proactive\" one where anyone could access public data without explicitly requesting to do so. The UK also launched its Open Data Initiative in 2010 followed by the EU Open Data Directive in 2019. Other countries like Canada, Australia, India, and Japan also implemented their respective open data policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the definition of Open Government Data as found in the [European Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/en/dataeuropa-academy/what-open-data):\n",
    "\n",
    "*Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use. These principles for Open Data are described in detail in the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/).*\n",
    "\n",
    "This subset of government data will drive (in part) the datasets that you will use at WQU. These real-world datasets will help you develop practical skills in data analysis and modeling while giving insight into economic indicators and other factors that influence the economy. In summary, transparency in government data has enriched both WQU's content and the learning process in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime example of open government data in action is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). Currently, FRED stands out as one of the most comprehensive and accessible economic databases available to the public. The data is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and given special care, in accordance with the principles of openess, as a crucial resource for researchers, policymakers, students, and the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3.1 Overview of FRED**\n",
    "\n",
    "FRED is a vast repository of economic time series data from various sources, not limited to the Federal Reserve System. It includes data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* U.S. government agencies (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* International organizations (e.g., World Bank, OECD)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Private sources (e.g., university research centers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The database covers a wide range of economic indicators, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n",
    "* Inflation rates\n",
    "* Employment statistics\n",
    "* Interest rates\n",
    "* Exchange rates\n",
    "* Consumer and producer price indices\n",
    "* Monetary aggregates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3.2 Key Features of FRED**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Accessibility: FRED data is freely available through a user-friendly web interface, mobile apps, and API access.\n",
    "2.  Data Visualization: Users can create custom charts and graphs directly on the FRED website.\n",
    "3. Data Download: Data can be easily downloaded in various formats (e.g., Excel, CSV) for further analysis.\n",
    "4. Regular Updates: FRED is updated in real time as new data becomes available from its sources.\n",
    "5. Historical Data: Many series in FRED go back several decades, providing valuable historical context.\n",
    "6. Data Transformation: FRED allows users to perform basic transformations on data series, such as changing units or calculating percent changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this lesson, we use the API gateway in order to make use of the statistical and visualization libraries of Python."

    "## **4. Yield Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will work with a specific type of yield curve called the Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) yield curve. In Financial Markets, students already got an introduction to this subject, and we will be supplementing that material with a hands-on data workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMT yield curve is a snapshot of all U.S. Treasury yields at a given date. Essentially, the U.S. Treasury uses the closing market bid yields (which are based on the prices that buyers are willing to pay (bid) instead of the actual transaction prices) in order to calculate CMT rates on a daily basis. You can find the overview of the methodology that the Treasury uses [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/interest-rate-statistics/treasury-yield-curve-methodology).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently, FRED has already performed these calculations and the CMT rates are freely available from their website or through the FRED API, which we can utilize through the `fredapi` Python library. In order to access the FRED data, every student must obtain an API key by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the FRED website: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html. Click on \"Create an Account\" in the top right corner (if you do not already have an account with FRED).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Log in to your FRED account and request an API key. Navigate to the \"API Keys\" selection of the \"My Account\" dropdown menu in the top right corner. Then, click on \"Request API Key.\""

The 20-year bond had an irregular issuance history because from 1986 to 1993, 20-year T-bonds were not issued. The same applies to the 30-year maturity, which was discontinued from February 2002 to February 2006. Furthermore, a great deal of missing values, as one can see with the more liquid bonds like the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year maturities, can be attributed to holidays and market disruptions."

    "### **4.1 The Shape of the Yield Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining Figure 3 along with the figures that you will have produced by now in answering Exercise 2, you have observed that the (most obvious) factors that define the shape of a yield curve are (Rebonato):\n",
    "1. The overall **level** of the yield curve, which translates into how high or how low interest rates are.\n",
    "2. The **slope** of the yield curve, which indicates how steep, flat, or inverted the curve is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we can explain about 90% of the variability of the curve through level and slope (Oprea). For a more thorough analysis, one would need to take into account:\n",
    "3. The **curvature**, which is a measure of how the middle of the curve (medium-term rates) behave in comparison to the short- and long-term rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this lesson, we will emphasize the first two factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4.1.1 Level of the Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "The level is associated with **parallel shifts** in the entire yield curve. In essence, it affects all bond prices regardless of maturity by (almost) the same magnitude. These *shifts* are driven by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, geopolitical events, changes in monetary policy, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the 1994 Bond Market Crash, also known as the Great Bond Massacre. The primary trigger of the bond crash was the Fed's decision to initiate a round of rate hikes. In February 1994, the Fed raised the funds rate from 3.00% to 3.25%. Over the course of the year, the Fed continued to raise rates incrementally, reaching 5.5% by February of 1995. The main driver behind the Fed's decision was inflation expectations due to the rapid economic expansion of 1993.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, prior to 1994, the spread between the short-term and long-term rates was more than 4 percentage points, leading many investors in leveraged positions to borrow short term and invest in longer-term bonds. Naturally, the sudden rate hikes caught these investors (among others) off guard, forcing them to unwind their position, leading to a selloff in the bond market."

The slope can be categorized into:\n",
    "1. A positive slope, also referred to as normal yield curve, which occurs when long-term yields are higher than the short-term ones. This is the \"normal\" scenario since we expect that the additional risk of holding long-term bonds should be compensated with higher returns than those of the short-term ones.\n",
    "2. A flat slope: short-term and long-term yields are similar.\n",
